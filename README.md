# Sunny

Sunny is a simple weather app made in **Flutter**.
It uses [yr.no](https://www.yr.no) as the weather provider.

### The app is a work in progress and it's here just to show my friend the progress I'm making.

## Things I still want to do:

- [ ] Make the **LoadingScreen** a bit nicer looking
- [ ] Move condition variables to *conditions.dart*
- [ ] Make a general icon for unknown weather, call it **noweather.svg**
- [ ] Remove *height* and *width* tags from each SVG
- [ ] Test on smaller devices, add scrolling functionality
- [ ] Implement a modal view to enter a new city
- [ ] Add a GPS icon on the top left to check for weather via location
- [ ] Long press on the menu icon brings you to the **InfoScreen**
- [ ] Implement the **InfoScreen**
- [ ] Colors should change depending on the weather condition
- [x] Replace hardcoded text with variables
- [x] Create other weather icons from the downloaded ones
- [x] Rename icons to the required names (e.g. **clearsky_day**)

### Gonna post some screenshots when I'm happy enough with the app and the UI.
### Gonna put the app on the Play Store when I'm generally happy with the app and it could serve other people.
